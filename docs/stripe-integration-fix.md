# Stripe Integration Fix

## Problem

The Stripe service was throwing an error when trying to create checkout sessions:

```
Error: You specified `payment` mode but passed a recurring price. Either switch to `subscription` mode or use only one-time prices.
```

## Solution

Added automatic mode detection based on price types:

- `'payment'` mode for one-time prices
- `'subscription'` mode for recurring prices
- Validation to prevent mixing price types

## Key Changes

1. **Automatic Mode Detection**: Service now checks price types and sets correct mode
2. **Mixed Price Prevention**: Prevents recurring + one-time prices in same session
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Logs mode detection and validation events
4. **Graceful Error Handling**: Falls back to original mode if validation fails

## Testing

```bash
pnpm run test:stripe-integration
```

## Benefits

- No manual mode specification needed
- Prevents common Stripe API errors
- Better error messages and validation
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
